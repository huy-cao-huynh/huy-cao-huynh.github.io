Nice to meet you! I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Washington, passionate about machine/deep learning and AI applications in real-world systems.

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at the [GRAIL Lab](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) under Prof. Steven Seitz and PhD Jingwei Ma, where I'm working on [UltraZoom](https://ultra-zoom.github.io/), a diffusion-based gigapixel imaging pipeline for microscopy.

Outside of research, I lead a **Husky Coding Project** team, where we are working on a mobile application called **DressMe**, a computer-vision powered outfit generator and virtual closet.

I'm seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills to impactful work that helps people, whether in health, accessibility, or tools that improve everyday life. I'm particularly motivated by projects that bridge research with product.
