Nice to meet you! I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Washington, passionate about machine/deep learning and AI applications in real-world systems.

I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at the **[GRAIL Lab](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/)** under the mentorship of PhD Jingwei Ma, and advised by Prof. Steve Seitz, Prof. Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, and Prof. Brian Curless, where I'm working on reference based super-resolution tasks. I'm also an undergraduate researcher at the **[UW Systems Lab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/)** under the mentorship of PhD Tapan Chugh, and advised by Arvind Krishnamurthy, where I'm working on debugging Web Agent Gateway System (WAGS) failures.

I'm seeking opportunities to apply my technical skills to impactful work that helps people, whether in health, accessibility, or tools that improve everyday life. I'm particularly motivated by projects that bridge research with product.

## 🔨 Projects
* 🗣️ **[LoRA-TTS](https://github.com/huy-cao-huynh/Lora-TTS-Efficient-Dialect-Adaptation)**: This project is a text-to-speech pipeline fine-tuned for Taiwanese-Mandarin accents.
* 🔬 **[UltraZoom](https://ultra-zoom.github.io/)**: This research project uses multidiffusion transformer models for super-resolution text-to-image tasks, such as increasing photo resolution.
* 🧫 **[VisTumor](https://github.com/huy-cao-huynh/VisTumor)**: This project is a deep learning pipeline for cancer detection in histopathology images, with model interpretability using Grad-CAM++ and saliency mapping.
* ♟️ **[Java Chess Engine](https://github.com/huy-cao-huynh/MockFish)**: This project is a fully functioning chess engine implemented in Java. The engine uses a Mini-Max/Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to evaluate board states and determine the best move for each player.
